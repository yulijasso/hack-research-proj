      "Mastering the cognitive knowledge within a field such as internal medicine is a\n",
      "formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, procure and\n",
      "filter through the clinical and laboratory data, develop a differential diagnosis, and,\n",
      "finally, make a rational treatment plan. To gain these skills, the student learns best\n",
      "at the bedside, guided and instructed by experienced teachers, and inspired toward\n",
      "self-directed, diligent reading. Clearly, there is no replacement for education at the\n",
      "bedside. Unfortunately, clinical situations usually do not encompass the breadth of\n",
      "the specialty. Perhaps the best alternative is a carefully crafted patient case designed\n",
      "to stimulate the clinical approach and the decision-making process. In an attempt\n",
      "to achieve that goal, we have constructed a collection of clinical vignettes to teach\n",
      "diagnostic or therapeutic approaches relevant to internal medicine.\n",
      "Most importantly, the explanations for the cases emphasize the mechanisms\n",
      "and underlying principles, rather than merely rote questions and answers. This\n",
      "book is organized for versatility: It allows the student “in a rush” to go quickly\n",
      "through the scenarios and check the corresponding answers, and it allows the\n",
      "student who wants thought-provoking explanations to obtain them. The answers\n",
      "are arranged from simple to complex: the bare answers, an analysis of the case, an\n",
      "approach to the pertinent topic, a comprehension test at the end, clinical pearls\n",
      "for emphasis, and a list of references for further reading. The clinical vignettes are\n",
      "organized by system to help students compare and contrast, and integrate infor-\n",
      "mation. A listing of cases is included later in this section to aid the student who\n",
      "desires to test his or her knowledge of a certain area, or to review a topic, including\n",
      "basic definitions. Finally, we intentionally did not use a multiple-choice question\n",

      "At times, the patient’s complaint is different from the most concerning issue, and\n",

      "different parts, discussed next.\n",

      "conditions are more common at certain ages; for instance, pain on defecation\n",
      "and rectal bleeding in a 20-year-old may indicate inflammatory bowel disease,\n",
      "whereas the same symptoms in a 60-year-old would more likely suggest colon\n",
      "cancer.\n",
      "2. Chief complaint: What is it that brought the patient into the hospital or clinic?\n",
      "Is it a scheduled appointment or an unexpected symptom? The patient’s own\n",
      "words should be used if possible, such as, “I feel like a ton of bricks are on my\n",

      "a. Illness: Any illnesses such as hypertension, hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, cancer,\n",
      "heart disease, pulmonary disease, and thyroid disease should be elicited. If\n",
      "an existing or prior diagnosis is not obvious, it is useful to ask exactly how\n",

      "listed with the reason(s) for admission, the intervention, and the location\n",
      "of the hospital.\n",
      "c. Blood transfusion: Transfusions with any blood products should be listed,\n",
      "including any adverse reactions.\n",
      "d. Surgeries: The year and type of surgery should be elucidated and any com-\n",
      "plications documented. The type of incision and any untoward effects of\n",
      "the anesthesia or the surgery should be noted.\n",
      "5. Allergies: Reactions to medications should be recorded, including severity and\n",
      "temporal relationship to the medication. An adverse effect (eg, nausea) should\n",
      "be differentiated from a true allergic reaction.\n",
      "6. Medications: Current and previous medications should be listed, including\n",
      "dosage, route, frequency, and duration of use. Prescription, over-the-counter,\n",
      "and herbal medications are all relevant. Patients often forget their complete\n",
      "medication list; thus, asking each patient to bring in all their medications—\n",
      "both prescribed and nonprescribed—allows for a complete inventory.\n",
      "7. Family history: Many conditions are inherited or are predisposed in family\n",
      "members. The age and health of siblings, parents, grandparents, and others can\n",
      "provide diagnostic clues. For instance, an individual with first-degree family\n",

      "9. Review of systems: A few questions about each major body system ensure that\n",
      "problems will not be overlooked. The clinician should avoid the mechanical\n",
      "“rapid-fire” questioning technique that discourages patients from answering\n",

      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n",
      "The physical examination begins as one is taking the history, by observing the\n",
      "patient and beginning to consider a differential diagnosis. When performing the\n",
      "physical examination, one focuses on body systems suggested by the differential\n",

      "mind (“one sees what one looks for”), the utility of the examination in adding to\n",
      "diagnostic yield is greatly increased, as opposed to an unfocused “head-to-toe”\n",
      "physical examination.\n",
      "1. General appearance: A great deal of information is gathered by observation, as\n",
      "one notes the patient’s body habitus, state of grooming, nutritional status, level\n",
      "of anxiety (or perhaps inappropriate indifference), degree of pain or comfort,\n",
      "mental status, speech patterns, and use of language. This forms your impres-\n",
      "sion of “who this patient is.”\n",
      "2. Vital signs: Vital signs like temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory\n",
      "rate, height, and weight are often placed here. Blood pressure can sometimes\n",
      "be different in the two arms; initially, it should be measured in both arms.\n",
      "In patients with suspected hypovolemia, pulse and blood pressure should be\n",
      "taken in lying and standing positions to look for orthostatic hypotension. It is\n",
      "quite useful to take the vital signs oneself, rather than relying upon numbers\n",
      "gathered by ancillary personnel using automated equipment, because impor-\n",
      "tant decisions regarding patient care are often made using the vital signs as an\n",
      "important determining factor.\n",
      "3. Head and neck examination: Facial or periorbital edema and pupillary responses\n",
      "should be noted. Fundoscopic examination provides a way to visualize the\n",
      "effects of diseases such as diabetes on the microvasculature; papilledema can\n",
      "signify increased intracranial pressure. Estimation of jugular venous pressure\n",
      "is very useful to estimate volume status. The thyroid should be palpated for a\n",

      "also with arms raised. With the patient sitting and supine, the breasts should\n",

      "assessed for discharge, and the axillary and supraclavicular regions should be\n",
      "examined for adenopathy.\n",
      "5. Cardiac examination: The point of maximal impulse should be ascertained for\n",
      "size and location, and the heart should be auscultated at the apex and at the\n",
      "base. Heart sounds, murmurs, and clicks should be characterized. Murmurs\n",
      "should be classified according to intensity, duration, timing in the cardiac cycle,\n",

      "and thoroughly. Wheezes, rales, rhonchi, and bronchial breath sounds should\n",
      "be recorded. Percussion of the lung fields may be helpful in identifying the\n",
      "hyperresonance of tension pneumothorax or the dullness of consolidated\n",

      "ful palpation should begin initially away from the area of pain, involving one\n",
      "hand on top of the other, to assess for masses, tenderness, and peritoneal signs.\n",
      "Tenderness should be recorded on a scale (eg, 1–4 where 4 is the most severe\n",
      "pain). Guarding, and whether it is voluntary or involuntary, should be noted.\n",
      "8. Back and spine examination: The back should be assessed for symmetry, ten-\n",
      "derness, and masses. The flank regions are particularly important to assess for\n",
      "pain on percussion, which might indicate renal disease.\n",
      "9. Genitalia:\n",
      "a. Females: The pelvic examination should include an inspection of the\n",
      "external genitalia and, with the speculum, evaluation of the vagina and\n",
      "cervix. A Papanicolaou test (Pap smear) and/or cervical cultures may be\n",
      "obtained. A bimanual examination to assess the size, shape, and tenderness\n",

      "1. The first step is to gather information with a differential diagnosis in mind. The\n",
      "clinician should start considering diagnostic possibilities with initial contact\n",
      "with the patient; these possibilities are continually refined as information is\n",
      "gathered. Historical questions and physical examination tests and findings are\n",
      "all tailored to the potential diagnoses one is considering. This is the principle\n",
      "that “you find what you are looking for.” When one is trying to perform a thor-\n",
      "ough head-to-toe examination, for instance, without looking for anything in\n",
      "particular, one is much more likely to miss findings.\n",
      "2. The next step is to try to move from subjective complaints or nonspecific\n",
      "symptoms to focus on objective abnormalities in an effort to conceptualize\n",
      "the patient’s objective problem with the greatest specificity one can achieve. For\n",
      "example, a patient may come to the physician complaining of pedal edema, a\n",
      "relatively common and nonspecific finding. Laboratory testing may reveal that\n",
      "the patient has renal failure, a more specific cause of the many causes of edema.\n",
      "Examination of the urine may then reveal red blood cell casts, indicating glo-\n",
      "merulonephritis, which is even more specific as the cause of the renal failure.\n",
      "The patient’s problem, then, described with the greatest degree of specificity, is\n",
      "glomerulonephritis. The clinician’s task at this point is to consider the differen-\n",
      "tial diagnosis of glomerulonephritis rather than that of pedal edema.\n",
      "3. The last step is to look for discriminating features of the patient’s illness. This\n",
      "means the features of the illness, which by their presence or their absence nar-\n",
      "row the differential diagnosis. This is often difficult for junior learners because\n",

      "that are likely to produce that radiographic pattern. A negatively predictive\n",
      "example is a patient with exudative pharyngitis who also has rhinorrhea and\n",

      "To answer this question, the clinician needs to reach the correct diagnosis, assess\n",

      "and the rationale for the therapy. A common error is for the student to “jump to a\n",
      "treatment,” like a random guess, and therefore be given “right or wrong” feedback.\n",
      "In fact, the student’s guess may be correct, but for the wrong reason; conversely,\n",

      "For example, if the question is, “What is the best therapy for a 25-year-old man\n",
      "who complains of a nontender penile ulcer?” the incorrect manner of response is\n",
      "for the student to blurt out “azithromycin.” Rather, the student should reason it out\n",
      "in a way similar to this: “The most common cause of a nontender infectious ulcer\n",

      "CLINICAL APPROACH\n",
      "Background and Epidemiology\n",
      "Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia for which patients seek treatment;\n",
      "it occurs in acute, paroxysmal, and chronic forms. With AF, there is disordered\n",
      "atrial depolarization from multiple irritable foci, often at rates exceeding 300 to\n",
      "400 bpm; these atrial impulses produce an irregular ventricular response, depend-\n",
      "ing on the number of impulses that are conducted through the atrioventricular\n",
      "(AV) node. The ECG is characterized by the absence of discrete P waves and an RR\n",
      "interval without a repetitive pattern, commonly referred to as an irregularly irregu-\n",
      "lar rhythm. The incidence of AF increases with age, affecting 5% to 10% of patients\n",
      "older than 75 years. Although many patients can maintain a normal activity level\n",
      "and remain essentially asymptomatic with chronic AF, there are several causes of\n",
      "morbidity from this arrhythmia: It may trigger a rapid ventricular rate, leading to\n",
      "myocardial ischemia, exacerbation of heart failure in patients with heart disease,\n",
      "and thrombus formation in the noncontractile atrial appendage, which can lead to\n",
      "systemic embolization (AF is a common cause of ischemic stroke).\n",
      "Pathophysiology\n",
      "Anything that causes atrial dilation or excessive sympathetic tone can lead to AF,\n",
      "but the two most common causes of AF are hypertension and coronary atherosclerosis.\n",
      "The common causes of AF are listed in Table 8–1.\n",
      "Treatment\n",
      "Acute AF. Acute AF with rapid ventricular response must be addressed quickly. The\n",
      "four major goals are (1) hemodynamic stabilization, (2) rate control, (3) anticoagu-\n",

      "unstable (hypotensive, angina pectoris, pulmonary edema), urgent DC cardiover-\n",

      "can generally be achieved with intravenous beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers,\n",
      "or digoxin, which slow conduction through the AV node. Once the ventricular\n",
      "rate has been controlled, the underlying cause (eg, thyrotoxicosis, use of adrener-\n",

      "stenosis, such as aortoiliac disease, may complain of exertional pain in the buttocks\n",

      "In a nonsmoker with a normal chest radiograph and absence of ACE inhibitor use,\n",
      "it may be due to upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), which is usually due to\n",
      "postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS), GERD, or asthma.\n",
      "SUBACUTE COUGH: Cough that is typically defined as lasting 3 to 8 weeks in\n",
      "duration and is most often infectious or postinfectious in etiology. Infectious eti-\n",
      "ologies of subacute cough include bacteria and viruses, such as respiratory syncytial\n",
      "virus, influenza, and adenovirus. Bacterial infections causing subacute cough are\n",
      "usually due to pertussis, Chlamydia, or mycoplasma.\n",
      "CLINICAL APPROACH\n",
      "Pathophysiology\n",
      "Chronic cough is a common complaint and accounts for a large portion of health\n",
      "care expenditures. Physiologically, cough is a reflexive defense mechanism to clear\n",
      "the upper airways. The action of a cough serves two main functions: (1) to protect\n",
      "the lungs against aspiration and (2) to clear secretions or other material into more\n",
      "proximal airways to be expectorated from the tracheobronchial tree. Evaluation\n",
      "begins with a detailed history and physical examination, including smoking habits,\n",
      "complete medication list, environmental and occupational exposures, and any his-\n",
      "tory of lung disease. Specific questions regarding the precipitating factors and dura-\n",
      "tion and nature of the cough should be elicited. Although the physical examination\n",
      "or nature of the cough rarely identifies the cause, meticulous review of the ears,\n",
      "nose, throat, and lungs may suggest a particular diagnosis. For example, a cobble-\n",
      "stone appearance of the oropharynx (representing lymphoid hyperplasia) or boggy\n",
      "erythematous nasal mucosa can be consistent with UACS. End-expiratory wheez-\n",
      "ing suggests active bronchospasm, whereas localized wheezing may be consistent with\n",
      "a foreign body or a bronchogenic tumor.\n",
      "In more than 90% of cases, a normal chest radiograph in an immunocompetent\n",
      "nonsmoker guides the clinician to one of three diagnoses: UACS, asthma, or GERD.\n",

      "Hepatitis A and E both are very contagious and transmitted either by the fecal-\n",

      "or from person to person, such as in day care settings by children. Hepatitis A\n",

      "United States. Hepatitis E is much less common and is found in Asia, Africa,\n",
      "Central America, and the Caribbean. Both hepatitis A and E infections usually\n",
      "lead to self-limited illnesses and generally resolve within weeks. Almost all patients\n",
      "with hepatitis A recover completely and have no long-term complications. Less\n",

      "United States and is usually sexually transmitted. It also may be acquired paren-\n",
      "terally, such as by intravenous drug use, or during birth from chronically infected\n",
      "mothers. The outcome depends on the age at which the infection was acquired.\n",
      "Up to 90% of infected newborns develop chronic hepatitis B infection, which\n",

      "CLINICAL APPROACH\n",
      "Pathophysiology\n",
      "Normally, the kidneys do not excrete appreciable amounts of protein (< 150 mg/d)\n",
      "because serum proteins are excluded from the urine by the glomerular membrane\n",

      "Proteinuria in excess of 3 to 3.5 g of protein per day is considered to be in the nephrotic\n",

      "to loss of albumin and other serum proteins. The hypoalbuminemia and decreased\n",

      "OLIGURIA: Less than 400 mL of urine output in 24 hours. Physiologically, it\n",
      "is the lowest amount of urine a person on a normal diet can make if he or she is\n",
      "severely dehydrated and does not retain uremic waste products. Oliguria is a poor\n",
      "prognostic sign in AKI. Patients with oliguric renal failure have higher mortality rates\n",
      "and worse renal recovery than patients who are nonoliguric.\n",
      "UREMIA: Nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, weakness, nausea with early morning\n",
      "vomiting, itchiness, confusion, pericarditis, and coma attributed to the retention of\n",
      "waste products in renal failure but do not always correlate with the BUN level.\n",

      "BUN and be uremic. Another patient may have a highly elevated BUN and be\n",

      "CLINICAL APPROACH\n",

      "The differential diagnosis of AKI proceeds from consideration of three basic\n",

      "Individuals with prerenal failure experience diminished GFR as a result of a\n",
      "marked decreased renal blood perfusion so that less glomerular filtrate is formed.\n",
      "Sometimes, the clinical presentation is straightforward, such as volume deple-\n",
      "tion from gastrointestinal fluid loss or hemorrhage; other times, the presentation\n",
      "of patients with prerenal failure can be more confusing. For example, a patient\n",
      "with severe nephrotic syndrome may appear to be volume overloaded because\n",
      "of the massive peripheral edema present; however, the effective arterial blood\n",
      "volume is very low as a consequence of severe hypoalbuminemia, resulting in a\n",

      "prerenal failure because of a low cardiac ejection fraction, yet at the same time be\n",
      "fluid overloaded with peripheral and pulmonary edema. The key is to assess “what\n",

      "degree relative with the diagnosis.\n",
      "Pathophysiology\n",
      "Parkinson disease is caused by depletion of dopamine in the basal ganglia, leading to\n",
      "the development of parkinsonian symptoms. The first three manifestations of PD\n",
      "are tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Postural instability is another salient feature\n",

      "that mimic PD include communicating hydrocephalus, lacunar infarcts, progres-\n",
      "sive supranuclear palsy, and diffuse Lewy body disease. However, these conditions\n",
      "do not respond to extended therapies of dopaminergic drugs.\n",
      "Three major subtypes of PD exist: tremor dominant, akinetic/rigid dominant,\n",
      "and gait difficulty or postural instability. The postural instability subtype tends to\n",
      "be the most life altering and disabling. These patients tend to exhibit significant\n",

      "the classifications variable and limited.\n",
      "Clinical Presentation\n",
      "The most common presenting symptom of PD is the tremor, which typically\n",
      "begins unilaterally in the hand and spreads contralaterally several years later.\n",
      "The “pill rolling” or resting tremor of PD is 4 to 6 Hz, and is most notable when the\n",
      "patient is not engaged in activities, and tends to be intermittent in the early stages\n",
      "of disease. With purposeful movements, the tremor of PD lessens, distinguishing\n",
      "it from other common conditions, such as essential tremor or multiple sclerosis.\n",
      "As symptoms progress, the tremor may become difficult to distinguish between an\n",
      "action and resting tremor.\n",
      "Bradykinesia or generalized slowing of movement is present at diagnosis in 80%\n",
      "of patients. Beginning distally, bradykinesia typically decreases manual dexterity,\n",
      "causing difficulty with simple activities of daily living in the upper extremities and\n",
      "difficulty walking in the lower extremities. Patients complain of a shuffling gait and\n",
      "feelings of unsteadiness. Evaluation of limb movements should include finger, heel,\n",
      "and toe tapping; hand gripping; and pronation/supination of the hands.\n",
      "Increased resistance to passive motion, or rigidity, is due to increased tone.\n",
      "Approximately 90% of patients exhibit some form of rigidity throughout the dis-\n",
      "ease course. Classically, cogwheel rigidity can be seen when the patient demonstrates\n",
      "a ratchety pattern of resistance as the limb is examined for range of motion. Addi-\n",
      "tionally, patients can have “lead-pipe” rigidity with constant resistance throughout\n",
      "the entire range of motion.\n",
      "As PD progresses, patients develop postural instability, in which the postural\n",
      "reflexes are impaired and lead to imbalance and falls. Clinicians should evaluate\n",
      "patients for postural instability by standing behind the patient and pulling back\n",
      "on the patient’s shoulders. This “pull” test is considered positive if the patient falls\n",
      "or has to take more than one step backward to maintain balance. Early falling and\n",
      "injuries should lead the clinician to consider different diseases than parkinsonian\n",
      "disease, such as supranuclear palsy or multiple-system atrophy (MSA).\n",
      "In addition to the four cardinal symptoms of PD, there are numerous motor and\n",
      "nonmotor features of the disease. Patients often exhibit hypomimia (masked facial\n",
      "expressions), impaired eye movements, blurry vision, and a shuffling gait. Meyer-\n",

      "CLINICAL APPROACH TO SHOCK\n",
      "Pathophysiology\n",
      "Shock is the clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. It can\n",
      "be classified in a variety of ways, but one useful schema divides the causes into\n",
      "hypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock, usually caused by\n",
      "sepsis. Hypovolemic shock is the most common form. It results from either hemor-\n",

      "volume. Cardiogenic shock results from a primary cardiac insult, such as a myo-\n",
      "cardial infarction, arrhythmia, or end-stage systolic heart failure. Both hypovole-\n",
      "mic and cardiogenic shock cause a marked fall in cardiac output and may appear\n",
      "clinically similar with tachycardia, hypotension, and cold, clammy extremities. It\n",
      "is essential to differentiate between the two, however, because the treatments are\n",
      "markedly different. Patients with hypovolemic shock should have flat neck veins\n",
      "and clear lung fields; those with cardiogenic shock are more likely to have markedly\n",

      "Distributive shock, in contrast, is characterized by an increase in cardiac output\n",

      "Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level < 135 mmol/L and is, by far, the\n",
      "most common electrolyte disturbance among hospitalized patients. Patients are often\n",
      "asymptomatic, especially if the hyponatremia develops slowly. Depending on how\n",
      "rapidly the hyponatremia develops, most patients do not have symptoms until the\n",
      "serum sodium level is in the low 120 mmol/L range. Note: since sodium is a mon-\n",
      "ovalent cation, 1 mmol/L = 1 mEq/L.\n",
      "Serum sodium concentrations are important because they almost always reflect\n",
      "tonicity, the effect of extracellular fluid on cells that will cause the cells (eg, brain\n",
      "cells) to swell (hypotonicity) or to shrink (hypertonicity). For purposes of this dis-\n",
      "cussion, we use serum osmolality as an indicator of tonicity.\n",
      "Hypotonic hyponatremia always occurs because there is water gain, that is,\n",
      "impairment of free water excretion. If one considers that the normal kidney capac-\n",
      "ity to excrete free water is approximately 18 to 20 L/d, it becomes apparent that\n",
      "it is very difficult to overwhelm this capacity solely through excessive water intake,\n",
      "as in psychogenic polydipsia. Therefore, when hyponatremia develops, the kidney\n",
      "is usually holding on to free water, either pathologically, as in SIADH, or physi-\n",
      "ologically, as an attempt to maintain effective circulating volume when patients are\n",
      "significantly volume depleted. Hyponatremia can also occur in cases of sodium loss,\n",
      "for example, as a consequence of diuretic use or because of aldosterone deficiency.\n",
      "However, in those cases, there is then a secondary gain of free water.\n",

      "Iron-Deficiency Anemia\n",
      "DEFINITIONS\n",
      "ANEMIA: Decreased red blood cell (RBC) mass, leading to less oxygen-carrying\n",
      "capacity. Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level less than 13 g/dL in men and less\n",
      "than 12 g/dL in women.\n",
      "IRON STUDIES: Ferritin is a marker of iron stores and is decreased in cases\n",
      "of iron deficiency. It is also an acute-phase reactant and therefore increases with\n",
      "inflammatory chronic diseases. The TIBC is an indirect measure of transferrin\n",
      "saturation levels and increases in iron deficiency.\n",
      "MEAN CORPUSCULAR VOLUME: MCV is the average of RBC volume. Based\n",
      "on RBC size, anemia is categorized as microcytic (MCV < 80 fL), normocytic\n",
      "(MCV 80-100 fL), and macrocytic (MCV > 100 fL).\n",
      "RETICULOCYTE: An immature RBC that usually is 1 to 1.5 days old.\n",
      "RETICULOCYTE COUNT: A fraction of RBCs consisting of reticulocytes that\n",
      "indirectly indicates the bone marrow activity of the erythrocyte line. It is usually\n",
      "expressed as a percentage, with a normal value of 0.5% to 2% in nonanemic adults;\n",
      "the reticulocyte index adjusts the count for the level of anemia.\n",
      "CLINICAL APPROACH\n",
      "Pathophysiology\n",
      "Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia in the United States,\n",
      "affecting all ages and both genders. Iron is essential to the synthesis of hemoglobin.\n",
      "The normal daily intake of elemental iron is approximately 15 mg, of which only\n",
      "1 to 2 mg are absorbed. The daily iron losses are about the same, and menstruation\n",
      "adds approximately 30 mg of iron lost each month.\n",
      "When iron loss exceeds intake, iron deposits are gradually depleted. Hemoglo-\n",
      "bin and serum iron levels may remain normal in the initial stages, and decreasing\n",
      "serum ferritin (iron stores) levels can be one of the first changes seen. This leads to a\n",
      "progressive decrease in iron available for RBC formation. The liver tries to compen-\n",
      "sate for this change by increasing transferrin production and maximizing the use of\n",
      "available iron. Transferrin levels are indirectly measured by TIBC. Due to increased\n",
      "transferrin production, TIBC is high in patients with iron-deficiency anemia. As a\n",
      "result, transferrin saturation (serum iron divided by TIBC) is low. Initially anemia\n",
      "will have normal-appearing RBCs, but as anemia becomes more severe, microcyto-\n",
      "sis and hypochromia will develop. Later in the disease process, iron deficiency will\n",
      "affect other tissues, resulting in a variety of symptoms and signs.\n",
      "Etiologies. The primary etiology for iron-deficiency anemia is blood loss\n",
      "(Table 54–1). In men, the most frequent cause is chronic GI tract occult bleed-\n",
      "ing; gastroenterology referral and endoscopic study of potential blood losses\n",

      "Although the treatment of iron deficiency is straightforward, finding the underly-\n",

      "daily, which provides 130 to 195 mg of elemental iron. Other iron preparations,\n",
      "such as ferrous fumarate or ferrous gluconate, can also be used and are equally\n",
      "effective. Correction of anemia usually occurs within 6 weeks, but therapy should\n",

      "portion will have withdrawal symptoms upon cessation. Excessive alcohol use is\n",
      "defined in men as 15 or more drinks per week and 5 or more drinks on a single\n",
      "occasion. In women, this is reduced to 8 drinks or more per week and 4 or more\n",
      "drinks on any single occasion. It is difficult to predict who specifically will suffer\n",

      "symptoms. Many Americans are also habituated to benzodiazepines, and the with-\n",
      "drawal syndrome is similar to alcohol withdrawal.\n",
      "Pathophysiology\n",
      "The withdrawal findings of alcohol or benzodiazepine cessation are complex and\n",
      "can be explained largely due to the interaction of ethanol to the postsynaptic gamma-\n",
      "aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors, which are inhibitory neurons. Long-term\n",
      "alcohol use leads to downregulation of the GABA-A receptors; the brain compen-\n",
      "sates for this chronic loss of excitatory neurotransmission by increasing excitatory\n",
      "neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. Thus, with\n",
      "the sudden cessation of alcohol, these excitatory neurotransmitters are unopposed,\n",
      "leading to profound effects.\n",
      "Clinical Presentation\n",
      "Alcohol withdrawal manifests as a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from minor\n",
      "tremulousness and insomnia to the most severe form, delirium tremens (DT),\n",
      "characterized by delirium, tremor, and autonomic hyperactivity. The severity of\n",
      "withdrawal can be assessed using a validated assessment tool, the Clinical Institute\n",
      "Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) scale. However, the CIWA is labor intensive for\n",
      "caregivers and especially tedious for nursing staff to conduct, so shorter assess-\n",

      "Risk factors for the development of DTs include a history of sustained drink-\n",

      "cal illness. Withdrawal can coexist with or mimic other conditions, such as\n",

Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed when the patient has hypotension with systolic\\narterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg, markedly reduced cardiac index less than\\n1.8 L/min/m2, and elevated LV filling pressure (measured indirectly with a pulmo-\\nnary capillary wedge pressure > 18 mm Hg). Clinically, such patients appear hypo-\\ntensive, with cold extremities because of peripheral vasoconstriction, pulmonary\\nedema, and elevated jugular venous pressure, reflecting high left- and right-sided\\nfilling pressures. Supportive treatment includes hemodynamic monitoring, ade-\\nquate ventilation and oxygenation, and blood pressure support with vasopressors\\nsuch as dobutamine and dopamine. These patients also may require mechanical\\nassistance to augment blood pressure while providing afterload reduction, using\\nintra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Cardiogenic shock may require urgent revas-\\ncularization with primary PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery.\\nHypotension may also be seen in patients with right ventricular (RV) infarction,\\nwhich is a complication of RCA occlusion and inferior infarction. In this case, LV\\nfunction is not impaired, but LV filling is dramatically reduced because of the right-\\nsided ventricular failure (the left heart can only pump out what it receives from the\\nright heart). These patients can be recognized clinically as hypotensive, with mark-\\nedly elevated jugular venous pressure but clear lung fields and no pulmonary edema\\nseen radiographically (in contrast to the pulmonary edema seen in patients with\\nhypotension to LV failure). The diagnosis is confirmed by observation of ST-\\nsegment elevation in a right-sided ECG. In this setting, RV function is impaired\\nand highly dependent on adequate preload, so treatment consists of volume\\nreplacement with crystalloid or colloid solution. Diuretics or nitrates should be\\navoided in these patients because they lower preload, which can cause catastrophic\\ncardiovascular collapse. Patients with RV dysfunction or failure may require ino-\\ntropic support to increase blood delivery to the LV.\\nMechanical Problems. A number of mechanical problems can complicate acute MI,\\nusually presenting within the first week with a new systolic murmur. The most\\ncommon is papillary muscle dysfunction caused by LV ischemia or infarction, lead-\\ning to mitral regurgitation, which may or may not be hemodynamically significant.\\nThis is in contrast with papillary muscle rupture, which produces a flail mitral\\nleaflet and acute mitral regurgitation with development of heart failure and car-\\ndiogenic shock. Ventricular septal rupture can also occur, possibly leading to devel-\\nopment of acute heart failure and shock. Transthoracic echocardiography can be\\nused to distinguish among these conditions. In all of them, stabilization of cardio-\\ngenic shock is accomplished using afterload reduction with intravenous nitroglyc-\\nerin or nitroprusside and sometimes with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation\\nuntil definitive, urgent, surgical repair can be accomplished. Other modalities of\\nmechanical circulatory support may be used for temporary support in cardiogenic\\nshock, including a LV assist device or venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane\\noxygenation (ECMO).\\nThe most catastrophic mechanical complication is rupture of the ventricular\\nfree wall. As blood fills the pericardium, cardiac tamponade develops rapidly, with\\nsudden pulselessness, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. This complication\\nnearly always is fatal.\\n04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 48 03/09/20 9:18 PM', 'Page Number': 75, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}, {'Information': '430 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE\\nCLINICAL APPROACH TO SHOCK\\nPathophysiology\\nShock is the clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. It can\\nbe classified in a variety of ways, but one useful schema divides the causes into\\nhypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock, usually caused by\\nsepsis. Hypovolemic shock is the most common form. It results from either hemor-\\nrhage or profound vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in loss of 20% to 40% of blood\\nvolume. Cardiogenic shock results from a primary cardiac insult, such as a myo-\\ncardial infarction, arrhythmia, or end-stage systolic heart failure. Both hypovole-\\nmic and cardiogenic shock cause a marked fall in cardiac output and may appear\\nclinically similar with tachycardia, hypotension, and cold, clammy extremities. It\\nis essential to differentiate between the two, however, because the treatments are\\nmarkedly different. Patients with hypovolemic shock should have flat neck veins\\nand clear lung fields; those with cardiogenic shock are more likely to have markedly\\nelevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary edema.\\nDistributive shock, in contrast, is characterized by an increase in cardiac output\\nbut an inability to maintain systemic vascular resistance, that is, there is inappro-\\npriate vasodilation. Clinically, it appears different from the other forms of shock in\\nthat, despite the hypotension, the extremities are warm and well perfused, at least\\ninitially. If septic shock continues, cardiac output falls as a consequence of myocar-\\ndial depression, multiorgan dysfunction ensues, and intense vasoconstriction occurs\\nin an attempt to maintain blood pressure, the so-called cold phase. These findings\\nportend a poor prognosis; hence, prompt recognition of septic shock in the early\\n(warm) phase is paramount.\\nAlthough distributive shock may occur in neurogenic shock as a consequence\\nof spinal cord injury or adrenal crisis, the most common cause is septic shock, with\\nthe most common infectious etiologies of sepsis being UTIs and pneumonia. Septic\\nshock is associated with high 30-day mortality rates, exceeding 50%. Early diagno-\\nsis and prompt treatment are imperative because untreated shock progresses to an\\nirreversible point that is refractory to volume expansion and other medical thera-\\npies. The qSOFA score is a rapid, bedside assessment of three variables: Glasgow\\nComa Score (≤ 14), systolic blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg), and respiratory rate\\n(> 22 breaths per minute). The presence of two of those three is associated with\\nhigh mortality.\\nNew Terminology. In 2016, the International Sepsis Consensus Conference\\n(Sepsis-3) recommended deemphasizing the use of SIRS (nonspecific) and instead\\nadopting SOFA as a more accurate prognostic indicator of the effects of sepsis.\\nTheir recommendation is that a total SOFA score of two or more points from base-\\nline represents organ dysfunction; however, the SOFA scores are research tools and\\nhave not yet been validated widely in clinical practice.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of hypovolemic shock is aggressive volume resuscitation, either with\\ncrystalloid solution or with blood products, as necessary. Treatment of cardiogenic\\nshock focuses on maintaining blood pressure with dopamine or norepinephrine\\n42_Toy-IM_Case41_p425-434.indd 430 03/09/20 9:06 PM', 'Page Number': 457, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}, {'Information': 'SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 431\\ninfusions, relief of pulmonary edema with diuretics, and reducing cardiac afterload,\\nfor example, with an intra-aortic balloon pump.\\nThe initial treatment for distributive shock is isotonic fluid resuscitation to\\nmaintain adequate intravascular volume. Other cornerstones of therapy include\\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics targeted to the underlying infection and removing the\\nsource of the infection. Patients often require vasopressor support (norepinephrine\\nis the agent of choice) and mechanical ventilation to optimize tissue oxygenation.\\nVasopressors increase systemic vascular resistance via vasoconstriction to increase\\norgan perfusion. The three main subtypes are catecholamine–, smooth muscle–,\\nand dopaminergic receptor–targeting vasopressors. Catecholamine vasopressors\\ntarget the alpha and/or beta receptors and include phenylephrine, norepinephrine,\\nand epinephrine. Vasopressin acts on smooth muscle V-1 receptors and renal V-2\\nreceptors for vasoconstrictive and antidiuretic uses, respectively; it has no iono-\\ntropic or chronotropic effects. Dopamine acts on dopaminergic, alpha, and beta\\nreceptors in a dose-dependent manner. IV hydrocortisone may be administered to\\npatients with hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.\\nSurviving Sepsis Campaign.

Sustained VT (> 30 seconds) and VF are life threatening because\\nthey prevent coordinated ventricular contraction, causing cardiovascular collapse.\\nThey are treated with defibrillation, followed by infusion of intravenous antiar-\\nrhythmics such as amiodarone. Electrolyte deficiencies, such as hypokalemia or\\nhypomagnesemia, can potentiate ventricular arrhythmias and should be corrected.\\nOne benign ventricular arrhythmia that is generally not suppressed by antiar-\\nrhythmics is the accelerated idioventricular rhythm. This is a wide-complex escape\\nrhythm between 60 and 110 bpm that frequently accompanies reperfusion of the\\nmyocardium but causes no hemodynamic compromise.\\nSupraventricular and Atrial Tachyarrhythmias. Supraventricular or atrial tachyar-\\nrhythmias are much less common after acute MI, but they can worsen ischemia and\\ncause infarct extension as a consequence of the rate-related increase in myocardial\\noxygen demand. When they cause hemodynamic instability, they also are treated\\nwith immediate direct current (DC) cardioversion.\\nBradyarrhythmias. Other frequent rhythm disturbances are bradyarrhythmias.\\nSinus bradycardia is frequently seen in inferior MI because the RCA supplies the\\nsinoatrial node, but the condition generally requires no treatment unless it causes\\nhypotension. If the heart rate is slow enough to cause cardiac output and blood\\npressure to fall, intravenous atropine is usually administered.\\nBradyarrhythmias can also be caused by atrioventricular (AV) conduction dis-\\nturbances. First-degree AV block (PR interval prolongation) and Mobitz I second-\\ndegree AV block (gradual prolongation of the PR interval before a nonconducted\\nP wave) are often caused by AV nodal dysfunction, for example, nodal ischemia\\ncaused by inferior MI. Patients who are symptomatic can be treated with atropine.\\nConduction Dysfunctions. Conduction disturbances below the AV node typically\\nproduce a widened QRS complex. Examples include Mobitz II second-degree AV\\nblock (nonconducted P waves not preceded by PR prolongation) and third-degree\\nAV block (complete AV dissociation with no P-wave conduction). Third-degree AV\\nblock also can be caused by AV nodal dysfunction. These arrhythmias are described\\nmore fully in other cases. Conduction disturbances caused by involvement of the\\nbundle of His include LBBB or right bundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior\\nhemiblock. Conduction disturbances below the AV node generally have a worse\\nprognosis than AV nodal dysfunction because they are generally seen with anterior\\ninfarction in which a significant amount of myocardium is damaged. When symp-\\ntomatic bradycardias such as third-degree AV block develop, they may be treated\\nwith external pacing but can require placement of a temporary transvenous pace-\\nmaker if the patient is in cardiogenic shock from complete heart block. Patients in\\npersistent complete heart block will require placement of a permanent pacemaker.\\nCardiac pump failure and cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock in acute MI usually\\nis the most severe form of LV pump failure, manifested by end-organ hypoperfu-\\nsion. Ischemic reduction in ventricular diastolic compliance may lead to transient\\npulmonary congestion, associated with elevated left-sided filling pressures. Exten-\\nsive myocardial necrosis and less contracting heart muscle may cause systolic failure\\nand reduced cardiac output. Patients with hypotension frequently are evaluated by\\n04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 47 03/09/20 9:18 PM', 'Page Number': 74, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}, {'Information': 'SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 111\\nAPPROACH TO:\\nSyncope\\nDEFINITIONS\\nCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE: Syncope due to the heart’s intrinsic failure to gener-\\nate sufficient cardiac output.\\nORTHOSTATIC SYNCOPE: Syncope due to failure of appropriate systemic\\nvasoconstriction, measured by a 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic pressure and a\\n10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic pressure.\\nSYNCOPE: A transient loss of consciousness and postural tone with subsequent\\nspontaneous recovery.\\nVASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: Fainting due to excessive vagal tone causing impaired\\nautonomic responses such as hypotension without appropriate rise in heart rate or\\nvasomotor tone.\\nCLINICAL APPROACH\\nEpidemiology\\nSyncope is a very common phenomenon, resulting in 3% of emergency center visits\\nand 1% of subsequent hospitalizations. The causes are varied, but they all result\\nin transiently diminished cerebral perfusion, leading to loss of consciousness. The\\nprognosis is quite varied, ranging from a benign episode in an otherwise young,\\nhealthy person with a clear precipitating event, such as emotional stress, to a more\\nserious occurrence in an older patient with cardiac disease. In the latter situation,\\nsyncope has been referred to as “sudden cardiac death, averted.” For that reason,\\nhigher-risk patients routinely undergo hospitalization and sometimes extensive\\nevaluation to determine the cause.\\nPathophysiology\\nTraditionally, the etiologies of syncope have been divided into neurogenic, vaso-\\nvagal, orthostatic, and cardiogenic—either arrhythmias or outflow obstruction.\\nTable 9–1 lists the most common causes of syncope. By far, the most useful evalu-\\nation for diagnosing the cause of syncope is the patient’s history. Because, by defini-\\ntion, the patient was unconscious, the patient may only be able to report preceding\\nand subsequent symptoms, so finding a witness to describe the episode is extremely\\nhelpful.\\nNeurogenic Syncope\\nNeurogenic syncope results from dysfunction of the autonomic function, which\\nleads to orthostatic hypotension as described in diabetes mellitus, multisystem\\natrophy, and idiopathic dysautonomia. Other neurologic diseases in the differen-\\ntial diagnosis for syncope include vertebrobasilar insufficiency, seizures, and tran-\\nsient ischemic attacks (TIAs).

A series of neurohu-\\nmoral responses develops, including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\\naxis and increased sympathetic activity, which initially may be compensatory but\\nultimately cause further cardiac decompensation. The most common cause of HF\\noverall is ischemic cardiomyopathy. Systolic dysfunction is classified via transthoracic\\nechocardiogram (TTE) by reduction of contractility (reduction in EF), in contrast to\\ndiastolic dysfunction, in which EF is preserved.\\nClinical Presentation\\nTypes of HF. Symptoms may be a result of forward failure (low cardiac output or\\nsystolic dysfunction), including fatigue, lethargy, and even hypotension, or backward\\nfailure (increased filling pressures or diastolic dysfunction), including dyspnea,\\n05_Toy-IM_Case04_p055-064.indd 57 03/09/20 9:17 PM', 'Page Number': 84, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}, {'Information': '130 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE\\nCASE CORRELATION\\nSee also Case 3 (Acute Coronary Syndrome), Case 4 (Heart Failure Due to\\n\\x9a\\nCritical Aortic Stenosis), Case 8 (Atrial Fibrillation/Mitral Stenosis), and\\nCase 10 (Acute Pericarditis Caused by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus).\\nCOMPREHENSION QUESTIONS\\n11.1 A 35-year-old woman is being seen for shortness of breath of 2 weeks’ dura-\\ntion.

Vasovagal syncope needs to be differentiated from ortho-\\nstatic hypotension.\\nCarotid sinus hypersensitivity is also vagally mediated. This usually occurs in\\nolder men, and episodes can be triggered by turning the head to the side, wearing\\na tight collar, or even shaving the neck over the area. Pressure over one or both\\ncarotid sinuses causes excess vagal activity with resultant cardiac slowing and can\\nproduce sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, or even AV block. Less commonly, carotid\\nsinus pressure can induce a fall in arterial pressure without cardiac slowing. When\\nrecurrent syncope as a result of bradyarrhythmia occurs, a demand pacemaker is\\noften required.\\nOrthostatic Hypotension\\nPatients with orthostatic hypotension typically report symptoms related to posi-\\ntional changes, such as rising from a seated or recumbent position. In orthostatic\\nhypotension, the postural drop in systolic blood pressure by more than 20 mm Hg, or\\n10 mm Hg diastolic, within 3 minutes of standing, can be demonstrated on exami-\\nnation. This can occur because of hypovolemia (hemorrhage, anemia, diarrhea, or\\nvomiting) or with impaired autonomic response despite adequate circulating blood\\nvolume. The most common reason for this autonomic impairment probably is iat-\\nrogenic as a result of antihypertensive or other medications, especially in elderly\\npersons. It also can be caused by autonomic insufficiency seen in diabetic neuropa-\\nthy, in a syndrome of chronic idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in older men, or in\\nother primary neurologic conditions (Parkinsonism or idiopathic dysautonomia).\\nMultiple unwitnessed events (not corroborated) or those that occur only in periods\\nof emotional upset suggest factitious symptoms.\\nCardiogenic Syncope\\nEtiologies of cardiogenic syncope include rhythm disturbances and structural heart\\nabnormalities. Certain structural heart abnormalities will cause obstruction of\\nblood flow to the brain, resulting in syncope. These include aortic stenosis and\\nhypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Syncope due to cardiac\\noutflow obstruction can also occur with cardiac tamponade, massive pulmonary\\nembolism, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Syncope caused by cardiac outflow\\nobstruction typically presents during or immediately after exertion. An echocardio-\\ngram often is obtained to elucidate such abnormalities.\\nArrhythmias. Arrhythmias, usually bradyarrhythmias, are the most common car-\\ndiac cause of syncope. Sinus bradycardia, most often due to degenerative sinoatrial\\n(SA) node dysfunction, and AV node block are bradyarrhythmic causes of syn-\\ncope. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in elderly patients is one of the most common\\ncauses for pacemaker placement. Patients with SSS may experience sinus brady-\\ncardia or arrest, alternating with a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), most often\\natrial fibrillation (tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). Additionally, prolonged QT\\ninterval may induce syncope. This can be acquired due to hypokalemia, hypomag-\\nnesemia, or medication use (eg, ondansetron). Also, some patients have congenital\\nprolonged QT syndromes. Tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter,\\n10_Toy-IM_Case09_p109-116.indd 113 03/09/20 9:12 PM', 'Page Number': 140, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}, {'Information': 'SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 59\\nTable 4–2 • SELECTED CAUSES OF HEART FAILURE\\nMyocardial injury\\n• Adriamycin\\n• Alcohol use\\n• Cocaine\\n• Ischemic cardiomyopathy (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease)\\n• Rheumatic fever\\n• Viral myocarditis\\nChronic pressure overload\\n• Aortic stenosis\\n• Hypertension\\nChronic volume overload\\n• Mitral regurgitation\\nInfiltrative diseases\\n• Amyloidosis\\n• Hemochromatosis\\nChronic tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia\\ntachycardia, alcohol consumption, or viral myocarditis may be reversible with\\nremoval of the inciting factor. In patients with underlying multivessel atheroscle-\\nrotic coronary disease and a low EF, revascularization with coronary artery bypass\\ngrafting improves cardiac function and prolongs survival. The three major treat-\\nment goals for patients with chronic HF are relief of symptoms, prevention of dis-\\nease progression, and a reduction in mortality risk.\\nRelief of Symptoms. The HF symptoms, which are mainly caused by low car-\\ndiac output and fluid overload, usually are relieved with lifestyle modifications and\\ndiuretics. Lifestyle changes may include reducing sodium intake to < 3 g daily, fluid\\nrestriction, establishing an exercise regimen, smoking cessation, and reduction of\\nalcohol intake.\\nPreventing Disease Progression. Because HF has such a substantial mortality,\\nmeasures to halt or reverse disease progression are necessary. Reversible causes\\nshould be aggressively sought and treated.\\nDecreasing Mortality Risk. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibi-\\ntors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and some beta-blockers, such as\\ncarvedilol (CAR), metoprolol, or bisoprolol, have been shown to reduce mortality\\nin patients with impaired systolic function and moderate-to-severe symptoms. In\\npatients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition (or in black patients in whom ACE\\ninhibitors appear to confer less benefit), the use of hydralazine with nitrates has\\nbeen shown to decrease mortality. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone\\nmay be added to patients with NYHA class III or IV HF with persistent symptoms,\\nbut patients should be monitored for hyperkalemia. Digoxin can be added to these\\nregimens for persistent symptoms, but it provides no survival benefit and can con-\\nfer significant toxicity at supratherapeutic levels. The mechanisms of these various\\nagents are outlined in Table 4–3. On the other hand, there are certain medica-\\ntions that are relatively contraindicated in HF; some examples include the nondi-\\nhydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem), which reduce\\n05_Toy-IM_Case04_p055-064.indd 59 03/09/20 9:17 PM', 'Page Number': 86, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}]], 'embeddings': None, 'documents': [['Case Files Internal Medicine 48 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE\\npulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheterization to assess hemodynamic parame-\\nters. Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed when the patient has hypotension with systolic\\narterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg, markedly reduced cardiac index less than\\n1.8 L/min/m2, and elevated LV filling pressure (measured indirectly with a pulmo-\\nnary capillary wedge pressure > 18 mm Hg). Clinically, such patients appear hypo-\\ntensive, with cold extremities because of peripheral vasoconstriction, pulmonary\\nedema, and elevated jugular venous pressure, reflecting high left- and right-sided\\nfilling pressures. Supportive treatment includes hemodynamic monitoring, ade-\\nquate ventilation and oxygenation, and blood pressure support with vasopressors\\nsuch as dobutamine and dopamine. These patients also may require mechanical\\nassistance to augment blood pressure while providing afterload reduction, using\\nintra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Cardiogenic shock may require urgent revas-\\ncularization with primary PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery.\\nHypotension may also be seen in patients with right ventricular (RV) infarction,\\nwhich is a complication of RCA occlusion and inferior infarction. In this case, LV\\nfunction is not impaired, but LV filling is dramatically reduced because of the right-\\nsided ventricular failure (the left heart can only pump out what it receives from the\\nright heart). These patients can be recognized clinically as hypotensive, with mark-\\nedly elevated jugular venous pressure but clear lung fields and no pulmonary edema\\nseen radiographically (in contrast to the pulmonary edema seen in patients with\\nhypotension to LV failure). The diagnosis is confirmed by observation of ST-\\nsegment elevation in a right-sided ECG. In this setting, RV function is impaired\\nand highly dependent on adequate preload, so treatment consists of volume\\nreplacement with crystalloid or colloid solution. Diuretics or nitrates should be\\navoided in these patients because they lower preload, which can cause catastrophic\\ncardiovascular collapse. Patients with RV dysfunction or failure may require ino-\\ntropic support to increase blood delivery to the LV.\\nMechanical Problems. A number of mechanical problems can complicate acute MI,\\nusually presenting within the first week with a new systolic murmur. The most\\ncommon is papillary muscle dysfunction caused by LV ischemia or infarction, lead-\\ning to mitral regurgitation, which may or may not be hemodynamically significant.\\nThis is in contrast with papillary muscle rupture, which produces a flail mitral\\nleaflet and acute mitral regurgitation with development of heart failure and car-\\ndiogenic shock. Ventricular septal rupture can also occur, possibly leading to devel-\\nopment of acute heart failure and shock. Transthoracic echocardiography can be\\nused to distinguish among these conditions. In all of them, stabilization of cardio-\\ngenic shock is accomplished using afterload reduction with intravenous nitroglyc-\\nerin or nitroprusside and sometimes with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation\\nuntil definitive, urgent, surgical repair can be accomplished. Other modalities of\\nmechanical circulatory support may be used for temporary support in cardiogenic\\nshock, including a LV assist device or venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane\\noxygenation (ECMO).\\nThe most catastrophic mechanical complication is rupture of the ventricular\\nfree wall. As blood fills the pericardium, cardiac tamponade develops rapidly, with\\nsudden pulselessness, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. This complication\\nnearly always is fatal.\\n04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 48 03/09/20 9:18 PM', 'Case Files Internal Medicine 430 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE\\nCLINICAL APPROACH TO SHOCK\\nPathophysiology\\nShock is the clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. It can\\nbe classified in a variety of ways, but one useful schema divides the causes into\\nhypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock, usually caused by\\nsepsis. Hypovolemic shock is the most common form. It results from either hemor-\\nrhage or profound vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in loss of 20% to 40% of blood\\nvolume. Cardiogenic shock results from a primary cardiac insult, such as a myo-\\ncardial infarction, arrhythmia, or end-stage systolic heart failure. Both hypovole-\\nmic and cardiogenic shock cause a marked fall in cardiac output and may appear\\nclinically similar with tachycardia, hypotension, and cold, clammy extremities. It\\nis essential to differentiate between the two, however, because the treatments are\\nmarkedly different. Patients with hypovolemic shock should have flat neck veins\\nand clear lung fields; those with cardiogenic shock are more likely to have markedly\\nelevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary edema.\\nDistributive shock, in contrast, is characterized by an increase in cardiac output\\nbut an inability to maintain systemic vascular resistance, that is, there is inappro-\\npriate vasodilation. Clinically, it appears different from the other forms of shock in\\nthat, despite the hypotension, the extremities are warm and well perfused, at least\\ninitially. If septic shock continues, cardiac output falls as a consequence of myocar-\\ndial depression, multiorgan dysfunction ensues, and intense vasoconstriction occurs\\nin an attempt to maintain blood pressure, the so-called cold phase. These findings\\nportend a poor prognosis; hence, prompt recognition of septic shock in the early\\n(warm) phase is paramount.\\nAlthough distributive shock may occur in neurogenic shock as a consequence\\nof spinal cord injury or adrenal crisis, the most common cause is septic shock, with\\nthe most common infectious etiologies of sepsis being UTIs and pneumonia. Septic\\nshock is associated with high 30-day mortality rates, exceeding 50%. Early diagno-\\nsis and prompt treatment are imperative because untreated shock progresses to an\\nirreversible point that is refractory to volume expansion and other medical thera-\\npies. The qSOFA score is a rapid, bedside assessment of three variables: Glasgow\\nComa Score (≤ 14), systolic blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg), and respiratory rate\\n(> 22 breaths per minute). The presence of two of those three is associated with\\nhigh mortality.\\nNew Terminology. In 2016, the International Sepsis Consensus Conference\\n(Sepsis-3) recommended deemphasizing the use of SIRS (nonspecific) and instead\\nadopting SOFA as a more accurate prognostic indicator of the effects of sepsis.\\nTheir recommendation is that a total SOFA score of two or more points from base-\\nline represents organ dysfunction; however, the SOFA scores are research tools and\\nhave not yet been validated widely in clinical practice.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of hypovolemic shock is aggressive volume resuscitation, either with\\ncrystalloid solution or with blood products, as necessary. Treatment of cardiogenic\\nshock focuses on maintaining blood pressure with dopamine or norepinephrine\\n42_Toy-IM_Case41_p425-434.indd 430 03/09/20 9:06 PM', 'Case Files Internal Medicine SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 431\\ninfusions, relief of pulmonary edema with diuretics, and reducing cardiac afterload,\\nfor example, with an intra-aortic balloon pump.\\nThe initial treatment for distributive shock is isotonic fluid resuscitation to\\nmaintain adequate intravascular volume. Other cornerstones of therapy include\\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics targeted to the underlying infection and removing the\\nsource of the infection. Patients often require vasopressor support (norepinephrine\\nis the agent of choice) and mechanical ventilation to optimize tissue oxygenation.\\nVasopressors increase systemic vascular resistance via vasoconstriction to increase\\norgan perfusion. The three main subtypes are catecholamine–, smooth muscle–,\\nand dopaminergic receptor–targeting vasopressors. Catecholamine vasopressors\\ntarget the alpha and/or beta receptors and include phenylephrine, norepinephrine,\\nand epinephrine. Vasopressin acts on smooth muscle V-1 receptors and renal V-2\\nreceptors for vasoconstrictive and antidiuretic uses, respectively; it has no iono-\\ntropic or chronotropic effects. Dopamine acts on dopaminergic, alpha, and beta\\nreceptors in a dose-dependent manner. IV hydrocortisone may be administered to\\npatients with hypotension that is refractory to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors.\\nSurviving Sepsis Campaign.

Sustained VT (> 30 seconds) and VF are life threatening because\\nthey prevent coordinated ventricular contraction, causing cardiovascular collapse.\\nThey are treated with defibrillation, followed by infusion of intravenous antiar-\\nrhythmics such as amiodarone. Electrolyte deficiencies, such as hypokalemia or\\nhypomagnesemia, can potentiate ventricular arrhythmias and should be corrected.\\nOne benign ventricular arrhythmia that is generally not suppressed by antiar-\\nrhythmics is the accelerated idioventricular rhythm. This is a wide-complex escape\\nrhythm between 60 and 110 bpm that frequently accompanies reperfusion of the\\nmyocardium but causes no hemodynamic compromise.\\nSupraventricular and Atrial Tachyarrhythmias. Supraventricular or atrial tachyar-\\nrhythmias are much less common after acute MI, but they can worsen ischemia and\\ncause infarct extension as a consequence of the rate-related increase in myocardial\\noxygen demand. When they cause hemodynamic instability, they also are treated\\nwith immediate direct current (DC) cardioversion.\\nBradyarrhythmias. Other frequent rhythm disturbances are bradyarrhythmias.\\nSinus bradycardia is frequently seen in inferior MI because the RCA supplies the\\nsinoatrial node, but the condition generally requires no treatment unless it causes\\nhypotension. If the heart rate is slow enough to cause cardiac output and blood\\npressure to fall, intravenous atropine is usually administered.\\nBradyarrhythmias can also be caused by atrioventricular (AV) conduction dis-\\nturbances. First-degree AV block (PR interval prolongation) and Mobitz I second-\\ndegree AV block (gradual prolongation of the PR interval before a nonconducted\\nP wave) are often caused by AV nodal dysfunction, for example, nodal ischemia\\ncaused by inferior MI. Patients who are symptomatic can be treated with atropine.\\nConduction Dysfunctions. Conduction disturbances below the AV node typically\\nproduce a widened QRS complex. Examples include Mobitz II second-degree AV\\nblock (nonconducted P waves not preceded by PR prolongation) and third-degree\\nAV block (complete AV dissociation with no P-wave conduction). Third-degree AV\\nblock also can be caused by AV nodal dysfunction. These arrhythmias are described\\nmore fully in other cases. Conduction disturbances caused by involvement of the\\nbundle of His include LBBB or right bundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior\\nhemiblock. Conduction disturbances below the AV node generally have a worse\\nprognosis than AV nodal dysfunction because they are generally seen with anterior\\ninfarction in which a significant amount of myocardium is damaged. When symp-\\ntomatic bradycardias such as third-degree AV block develop, they may be treated\\nwith external pacing but can require placement of a temporary transvenous pace-\\nmaker if the patient is in cardiogenic shock from complete heart block. Patients in\\npersistent complete heart block will require placement of a permanent pacemaker.\\nCardiac pump failure and cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock in acute MI usually\\nis the most severe form of LV pump failure, manifested by end-organ hypoperfu-\\nsion. Ischemic reduction in ventricular diastolic compliance may lead to transient\\npulmonary congestion, associated with elevated left-sided filling pressures. Exten-\\nsive myocardial necrosis and less contracting heart muscle may cause systolic failure\\nand reduced cardiac output. Patients with hypotension frequently are evaluated by\\n04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 47 03/09/20 9:18 PM', 'Case Files Internal Medicine SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 111\\nAPPROACH TO:\\nSyncope\\nDEFINITIONS\\nCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE: Syncope due to the heart’s intrinsic failure to gener-\\nate sufficient cardiac output.\\nORTHOSTATIC SYNCOPE: Syncope due to failure of appropriate systemic\\nvasoconstriction, measured by a 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic pressure and a\\n10 mm Hg decrease in diastolic pressure.\\nSYNCOPE: A transient loss of consciousness and postural tone with subsequent\\nspontaneous recovery.\\nVASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: Fainting due to excessive vagal tone causing impaired\\nautonomic responses such as hypotension without appropriate rise in heart rate or\\nvasomotor tone.\\nCLINICAL APPROACH\\nEpidemiology\\nSyncope is a very common phenomenon, resulting in 3% of emergency center visits\\nand 1% of subsequent hospitalizations. The causes are varied, but they all result\\nin transiently diminished cerebral perfusion, leading to loss of consciousness. The\\nprognosis is quite varied, ranging from a benign episode in an otherwise young,\\nhealthy person with a clear precipitating event, such as emotional stress, to a more\\nserious occurrence in an older patient with cardiac disease. In the latter situation,\\nsyncope has been referred to as “sudden cardiac death, averted.” For that reason,\\nhigher-risk patients routinely undergo hospitalization and sometimes extensive\\nevaluation to determine the cause.\\nPathophysiology\\nTraditionally, the etiologies of syncope have been divided into neurogenic, vaso-\\nvagal, orthostatic, and cardiogenic—either arrhythmias or outflow obstruction.\\nTable 9–1 lists the most common causes of syncope. By far, the most useful evalu-\\nation for diagnosing the cause of syncope is the patient’s history. Because, by defini-\\ntion, the patient was unconscious, the patient may only be able to report preceding\\nand subsequent symptoms, so finding a witness to describe the episode is extremely\\nhelpful.\\nNeurogenic Syncope\\nNeurogenic syncope results from dysfunction of the autonomic function, which\\nleads to orthostatic hypotension as described in diabetes mellitus, multisystem\\natrophy, and idiopathic dysautonomia. Other neurologic diseases in the differen-\\ntial diagnosis for syncope include vertebrobasilar insufficiency, seizures, and tran-\\nsient ischemic attacks (TIAs).

HF is a clinical\\nsyndrome that is produced when the heart is unable to meet the metabolic needs of\\nthe body while maintaining normal ventricular filling pressures. A series of neurohu-\\nmoral responses develops, including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\\naxis and increased sympathetic activity, which initially may be compensatory but\\nultimately cause further cardiac decompensation. The most common cause of HF\\noverall is ischemic cardiomyopathy. Systolic dysfunction is classified via transthoracic\\nechocardiogram (TTE) by reduction of contractility (reduction in EF), in contrast to\\ndiastolic dysfunction, in which EF is preserved.\\nClinical Presentation\\nTypes of HF.

This usually occurs in\\nolder men, and episodes can be triggered by turning the head to the side, wearing\\na tight collar, or even shaving the neck over the area. Pressure over one or both\\ncarotid sinuses causes excess vagal activity with resultant cardiac slowing and can\\nproduce sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, or even AV block. Less commonly, carotid\\nsinus pressure can induce a fall in arterial pressure without cardiac slowing. When\\nrecurrent syncope as a result of bradyarrhythmia occurs, a demand pacemaker is\\noften required.\\nOrthostatic Hypotension\\nPatients with orthostatic hypotension typically report symptoms related to posi-\\ntional changes, such as rising from a seated or recumbent position. In orthostatic\\nhypotension, the postural drop in systolic blood pressure by more than 20 mm Hg, or\\n10 mm Hg diastolic, within 3 minutes of standing, can be demonstrated on exami-\\nnation. This can occur because of hypovolemia (hemorrhage, anemia, diarrhea, or\\nvomiting) or with impaired autonomic response despite adequate circulating blood\\nvolume. The most common reason for this autonomic impairment probably is iat-\\nrogenic as a result of antihypertensive or other medications, especially in elderly\\npersons. It also can be caused by autonomic insufficiency seen in diabetic neuropa-\\nthy, in a syndrome of chronic idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in older men, or in\\nother primary neurologic conditions (Parkinsonism or idiopathic dysautonomia).\\nMultiple unwitnessed events (not corroborated) or those that occur only in periods\\nof emotional upset suggest factitious symptoms.\\nCardiogenic Syncope\\nEtiologies of cardiogenic syncope include rhythm disturbances and structural heart\\nabnormalities. Certain structural heart abnormalities will cause obstruction of\\nblood flow to the brain, resulting in syncope. These include aortic stenosis and\\nhypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Syncope due to cardiac\\noutflow obstruction can also occur with cardiac tamponade, massive pulmonary\\nembolism, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Syncope caused by cardiac outflow\\nobstruction typically presents during or immediately after exertion. An echocardio-\\ngram often is obtained to elucidate such abnormalities.\\nArrhythmias. Arrhythmias, usually bradyarrhythmias, are the most common car-\\ndiac cause of syncope. Sinus bradycardia, most often due to degenerative sinoatrial\\n(SA) node dysfunction, and AV node block are bradyarrhythmic causes of syn-\\ncope. Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in elderly patients is one of the most common\\ncauses for pacemaker placement. Patients with SSS may experience sinus brady-\\ncardia or arrest, alternating with a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), most often\\natrial fibrillation (tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome). Additionally, prolonged QT\\ninterval may induce syncope. This can be acquired due to hypokalemia, hypomag-\\nnesemia, or medication use (eg, ondansetron). Also, some patients have congenital\\nprolonged QT syndromes. Tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or flutter,\\n10_Toy-IM_Case09_p109-116.indd 113 03/09/20 9:12 PM', 'Case Files Internal Medicine SECTION II: CLINICAL CASES 59\\nTable 4–2 • SELECTED CAUSES OF HEART FAILURE\\nMyocardial injury\\n• Adriamycin\\n• Alcohol use\\n• Cocaine\\n• Ischemic cardiomyopathy (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease)\\n• Rheumatic fever\\n• Viral myocarditis\\nChronic pressure overload\\n• Aortic stenosis\\n• Hypertension\\nChronic volume overload\\n• Mitral regurgitation\\nInfiltrative diseases\\n• Amyloidosis\\n• Hemochromatosis\\nChronic tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia\\ntachycardia, alcohol consumption, or viral myocarditis may be reversible with\\nremoval of the inciting factor. In patients with underlying multivessel atheroscle-\\nrotic coronary disease and a low EF, revascularization with coronary artery bypass\\ngrafting improves cardiac function and prolongs survival. The three major treat-\\nment goals for patients with chronic HF are relief of symptoms, prevention of dis-\\nease progression, and a reduction in mortality risk.\\nRelief of Symptoms. The HF symptoms, which are mainly caused by low car-\\ndiac output and fluid overload, usually are relieved with lifestyle modifications and\\ndiuretics. Lifestyle changes may include reducing sodium intake to < 3 g daily, fluid\\nrestriction, establishing an exercise regimen, smoking cessation, and reduction of\\nalcohol intake.\\nPreventing Disease Progression. Because HF has such a substantial mortality,\\nmeasures to halt or reverse disease progression are necessary. Reversible causes\\nshould be aggressively sought and treated.\\nDecreasing Mortality Risk. Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibi-\\ntors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and some beta-blockers, such as\\ncarvedilol (CAR), metoprolol, or bisoprolol, have been shown to reduce mortality\\nin patients with impaired systolic function and moderate-to-severe symptoms. In\\npatients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibition (or in black patients in whom ACE\\ninhibitors appear to confer less benefit), the use of hydralazine with nitrates has\\nbeen shown to decrease mortality. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone\\nmay be added to patients with NYHA class III or IV HF with persistent symptoms,\\nbut patients should be monitored for hyperkalemia. Digoxin can be added to these\\nregimens for persistent symptoms, but it provides no survival benefit and can con-\\nfer significant toxicity at supratherapeutic levels. The mechanisms of these various\\nagents are outlined in Table 4–3. On the other hand, there are certain medica-\\ntions that are relatively contraindicated in HF; some examples include the nondi-\\nhydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem), which reduce\\n05_Toy-IM_Case04_p055-064.indd 59 03/09/20 9:17 PM']]}\n"

      "[{'Information': '48 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE\\npulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheterization to assess hemodynamic parame-\\nters. Cardiogenic shock is diagnosed when the patient has hypotension with systolic\\narterial pressure less than 80 mm Hg, markedly reduced cardiac index less than\\n1.8 L/min/m2, and elevated LV filling pressure (measured indirectly with a pulmo-\\nnary capillary wedge pressure > 18 mm Hg). Clinically, such patients appear hypo-\\ntensive, with cold extremities because of peripheral vasoconstriction, pulmonary\\nedema, and elevated jugular venous pressure, reflecting high left- and right-sided\\nfilling pressures. Supportive treatment includes hemodynamic monitoring, ade-\\nquate ventilation and oxygenation, and blood pressure support with vasopressors\\nsuch as dobutamine and dopamine. These patients also may require mechanical\\nassistance to augment blood pressure while providing afterload reduction, using\\nintra-aortic balloon counterpulsation. Cardiogenic shock may require urgent revas-\\ncularization with primary PCI or coronary artery bypass surgery.\\nHypotension may also be seen in patients with right ventricular (RV) infarction,\\nwhich is a complication of RCA occlusion and inferior infarction. In this case, LV\\nfunction is not impaired, but LV filling is dramatically reduced because of the right-\\nsided ventricular failure (the left heart can only pump out what it receives from the\\nright heart). These patients can be recognized clinically as hypotensive, with mark-\\nedly elevated jugular venous pressure but clear lung fields and no pulmonary edema\\nseen radiographically (in contrast to the pulmonary edema seen in patients with\\nhypotension to LV failure). The diagnosis is confirmed by observation of ST-\\nsegment elevation in a right-sided ECG. In this setting, RV function is impaired\\nand highly dependent on adequate preload, so treatment consists of volume\\nreplacement with crystalloid or colloid solution. Diuretics or nitrates should be\\navoided in these patients because they lower preload, which can cause catastrophic\\ncardiovascular collapse. Patients with RV dysfunction or failure may require ino-\\ntropic support to increase blood delivery to the LV.\\nMechanical Problems. A number of mechanical problems can complicate acute MI,\\nusually presenting within the first week with a new systolic murmur. The most\\ncommon is papillary muscle dysfunction caused by LV ischemia or infarction, lead-\\ning to mitral regurgitation, which may or may not be hemodynamically significant.\\nThis is in contrast with papillary muscle rupture, which produces a flail mitral\\nleaflet and acute mitral regurgitation with development of heart failure and car-\\ndiogenic shock. Ventricular septal rupture can also occur, possibly leading to devel-\\nopment of acute heart failure and shock. Transthoracic echocardiography can be\\nused to distinguish among these conditions. In all of them, stabilization of cardio-\\ngenic shock is accomplished using afterload reduction with intravenous nitroglyc-\\nerin or nitroprusside and sometimes with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation\\nuntil definitive, urgent, surgical repair can be accomplished. Other modalities of\\nmechanical circulatory support may be used for temporary support in cardiogenic\\nshock, including a LV assist device or venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane\\noxygenation (ECMO).\\nThe most catastrophic mechanical complication is rupture of the ventricular\\nfree wall. As blood fills the pericardium, cardiac tamponade develops rapidly, with\\nsudden pulselessness, hypotension, and loss of consciousness. This complication\\nnearly always is fatal.\\n04_Toy-IM_Case03_p039-054.indd 48 03/09/20 9:18 PM', 'Page Number': 75, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}, {'Information': '430 CASE FILES: INTERNAL MEDICINE\\nCLINICAL APPROACH TO SHOCK\\nPathophysiology\\nShock is the clinical syndrome that results from inadequate tissue perfusion. It can\\nbe classified in a variety of ways, but one useful schema divides the causes into\\nhypovolemic shock, cardiogenic shock, or distributive shock, usually caused by\\nsepsis. Hypovolemic shock is the most common form. It results from either hemor-\\nrhage or profound vomiting or diarrhea, resulting in loss of 20% to 40% of blood\\nvolume. Cardiogenic shock results from a primary cardiac insult, such as a myo-\\ncardial infarction, arrhythmia, or end-stage systolic heart failure. Both hypovole-\\nmic and cardiogenic shock cause a marked fall in cardiac output and may appear\\nclinically similar with tachycardia, hypotension, and cold, clammy extremities. It\\nis essential to differentiate between the two, however, because the treatments are\\nmarkedly different. Patients with hypovolemic shock should have flat neck veins\\nand clear lung fields; those with cardiogenic shock are more likely to have markedly\\nelevated jugular venous pressure and pulmonary edema.\\nDistributive shock, in contrast, is characterized by an increase in cardiac output\\nbut an inability to maintain systemic vascular resistance, that is, there is inappro-\\npriate vasodilation. Clinically, it appears different from the other forms of shock in\\nthat, despite the hypotension, the extremities are warm and well perfused, at least\\ninitially. If septic shock continues, cardiac output falls as a consequence of myocar-\\ndial depression, multiorgan dysfunction ensues, and intense vasoconstriction occurs\\nin an attempt to maintain blood pressure, the so-called cold phase. These findings\\nportend a poor prognosis; hence, prompt recognition of septic shock in the early\\n(warm) phase is paramount.\\nAlthough distributive shock may occur in neurogenic shock as a consequence\\nof spinal cord injury or adrenal crisis, the most common cause is septic shock, with\\nthe most common infectious etiologies of sepsis being UTIs and pneumonia. Septic\\nshock is associated with high 30-day mortality rates, exceeding 50%. Early diagno-\\nsis and prompt treatment are imperative because untreated shock progresses to an\\nirreversible point that is refractory to volume expansion and other medical thera-\\npies. The qSOFA score is a rapid, bedside assessment of three variables: Glasgow\\nComa Score (≤ 14), systolic blood pressure (≤ 100 mm Hg), and respiratory rate\\n(> 22 breaths per minute). The presence of two of those three is associated with\\nhigh mortality.\\nNew Terminology. In 2016, the International Sepsis Consensus Conference\\n(Sepsis-3) recommended deemphasizing the use of SIRS (nonspecific) and instead\\nadopting SOFA as a more accurate prognostic indicator of the effects of sepsis.\\nTheir recommendation is that a total SOFA score of two or more points from base-\\nline represents organ dysfunction; however, the SOFA scores are research tools and\\nhave not yet been validated widely in clinical practice.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of hypovolemic shock is aggressive volume resuscitation, either with\\ncrystalloid solution or with blood products, as necessary. Treatment of cardiogenic\\nshock focuses on maintaining blood pressure with dopamine or norepinephrine\\n42_Toy-IM_Case41_p425-434.indd 430 03/09/20 9:06 PM', 'Page Number': 457, 'source': 'output.csv', 'textbook_title': 'Case Files Internal Medicine'}]\n"
